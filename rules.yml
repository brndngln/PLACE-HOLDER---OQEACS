# Layer rules define which layers are permitted to import which.  Each
# key is a layer name inferred from file paths (e.g. a file inside
# "handler" directory is treated as layer "handler").  "forbidden_imports"
# lists layers that must not be imported by this layer.  Unspecified
# layers have no restrictions.
